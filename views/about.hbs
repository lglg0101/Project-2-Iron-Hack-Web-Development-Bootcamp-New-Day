  <h1>What is New Day?</h1>

  <p class = "m-2">

‘New Day’ is based on the psychology behind the ‘5 Minute Journal’, created by UJ Ramdas and Alex Ikonn
<br>
The structured process of answering 5 daily questions is designed to cultivate a positive mindset, encourage gratitude, redirect focus onto goals and encourage reflection on your day. 
<br>
The app is structured so you only spend a short amount of time writing in the journal. 
The goal is to not note every thought and feeling you have, but instead use it as a tool to start and end your day on a more positive note. 
<br>
Answer the questions, read the inspirational quote, and continue with your day. 
<br>
If you miss an entry, no problem.
<br>
Tomorrow is a New Day….</p>
